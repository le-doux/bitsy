# Room

<h1>Description</h1>

A 'room' in Bitsy is where the action takes place! Rooms are where your avatar walks around and talks to others. 
You may have as many rooms as you would like and can connect them together using the [exits & endings tool](../exitsandendings), allowing your avatar to walk between them. 

Rooms are always composed of 16x16 tiles, but what is in each of those tiles is up to you. 

There are several [room editing rools](../room/roomEditingTools) and [room settings](../room/roomSettings) available at the bottom of the room tool that allow you to change the appearance, behaviour and audio of each room.

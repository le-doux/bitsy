2. **Find drawing button**. Opens the find tool on the avatar tab.

3. **Paint canvas**. Edit the currently selected drawing by clicking the pixels to toggle them on / off. Any changes are also updated immediately in the [room tool](../room).

4. **Show / hide grid**. Toggle a pixel grid on / off in the paint canvas. The grid is not displayed when playing the game.
